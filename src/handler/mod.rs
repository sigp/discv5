//! Session and packet handling for the Discv5 Discovery service.
//!
//! The [`Handler`] is responsible for establishing and maintaining sessions with
//! connected/discovered nodes. Each node, identified by it's [`NodeId`] is associated with a
//! `Session`. This service drives the handshakes for establishing the sessions and associated
//! logic for sending/requesting initial connections/ENR's to/from unknown peers.
//!
//! The [`Handler`] also manages the timeouts for each request and reports back RPC failures,
//! and received messages. Messages are encrypted and decrypted using the
//! associated `Session` for each node.
//!
//! An ongoing established connection is abstractly represented by a `Session`. A node that provides an ENR with an
//! IP address/port that doesn't match the source, is considered invalid. A node that doesn't know
//! their external contactable addresses should set their ENR IP field to `None`.
//!
//! The Handler also routinely checks the timeouts for banned nodes and removes them from the
//! banned list once their ban expires.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Interacting with a handler is done via channels. A Handler is spawned using the [`Handler::spawn`]
//! function. This returns an exit channel, a sending and receiving channel respectively. If the
//! exit channel is dropped or fired, the handler task gets shutdown.
//!
//! Requests from the application layer can be made via the receive channel using a [`HandlerIn`].
//! Responses from the application layer can be made via the receive channel using a [`HandlerIn`].
//! Messages from a node on the network come by [`Socket`] and get the form of a [`HandlerOut`]
//! and can be forwarded to the application layer via the send channel.
