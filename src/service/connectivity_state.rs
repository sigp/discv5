//! This keeps track of our whether we should advertise an external IP address or not based on
//! whether we think we are externally contactable or not.
//!
//! We determine this by advertising our discovered IP address, if we receive inbound connections,
//! then we know we are externally contactable. If we see nothing for a period of time, we consider
//! ourselves non-contactable and revoke our advertised IP address. We wait for
//! DURATION_UNTIL_NEXT_CONNECTIVITY_ATTEMPT before trying again.
//!
//!
//! The process works via the following:
//! 1. Our ENR socket gets updated
//! 2. This triggers us to set an incoming wait timer
//! 3. a. If we receive an incoming connection within this time, we consider ourselves contactable
//! and we remove the timer.
//! 3. b. If we don't receive a connection and the timer expires. If the timer expires, we set our
//! external ENR address to None and set the `next_connectivity_test` to
//! DURATION_UNTIL_NEXT_CONNECTIVITY_ATTEMPT in the future. This will prevent counting votes until
//! this time, which prevents our ENR from being updated.
